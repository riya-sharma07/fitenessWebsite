                    Improves hip stability: By engaging the muscles around the hips and pelvis, the bridge exercise can help improve hip stability and reduce the risk of injuries.
                    
                    Enhances lower body strength: This exercise also engages the hamstrings, quadriceps, and calves, helping to strengthen the lower body muscles.

                <p id="parra1">
                    Knee pushups, also known as modified pushups, offer a variety of benefits, especially for individuals who are working on improving their upper body strength or are unable to perform full standard pushups. Here are some benefits of knee pushups:
                    Strengthens chest, shoulders, and arms: Knee pushups target the chest, shoulders, and arms, helping to build strength in these upper body muscles.
                    Engages core muscles: While performing knee pushups, the core muscles are engaged to stabilize the body, leading to improved core strength.
                    Reduces wrist strain: Knee pushups can be an excellent alternative for individuals who experience wrist pain or strain during regular pushups, as they put less stress on the wrists.</p>

                <h3>Wall Squat</h3>
                <br>
                <p id="parra">Wall squats, also known as wall sits, are a beneficial lower body exercise that offers several advantages for building strength and endurance. Here are some benefits of wall squats:

                    Strengthens the quadriceps: Wall squats primarily target the quadriceps, the large muscles at the front of the thighs. By holding a static squat position against the wall, these muscles are engaged and strengthened.
                    
                    Engages the glutes and hamstrings: Wall squats also engage the glutes (buttocks) and hamstrings (back of the thighs), helping to improve overall lower body strength.
                    
                    Improves endurance: Holding a wall squat position for an extended period can help improve muscular endurance in the lower body, which can be beneficial for various physical activities and sports.
