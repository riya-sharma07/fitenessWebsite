                    cholesterol-free
                    high in soluble and insoluble fibre, and resistant starch
                    an excellent source of carbohydrates
                    a significant source of protein
                    a good source of B group vitamins, including folate

                    <p id="parra">Soluble fiber helps slow down your digestion and makes you feel fuller for longer, which might make losing weight easier. One study found that doubling your fiber intake may lower how many calories your body absorbs.Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in people over age 55. A large-scale study showed that antioxidants can reduce your risk of developing AMD. A separate study found that goji berries may increase your macular pigment density, which affects your overall eye function, but we need more research to understand these findings.Antioxidants in berries may also help prevent and treat cataract, which develops when protein builds up in the lens of your eye. Studies show there could be a connection between a lack of antioxidants, such as vitamin C, and cataracts, but more research is needed to understand whether the antioxidants can stop cataracts from forming.</p>
